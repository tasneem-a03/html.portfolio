<h1>The Best Books According to Tasnim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 books of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fine print</h3>
<p>This is my favourite book. This book is by Lauren Asher. And it is about billionare whose name is Rowan and he is grumpy and a girl name Zahra who is sweet and gives sunshine kinda vibe
<h3>Twisted hate</h3>
<p>This is also my favourite book. This book is by Ana Huang. And this is the story about Alex and Ava. Again Billionare, Grumpy-sunshine trope.</p>
<h3>The Love Hypothesis</h3>
<p>This is also my favourite book by Ali Hazelwood. I think we all have been in a phase where we've fallen in love with some teacher... This book brings it to reality! A really fun, light-hearted, sensual and romantic story. Plus, Ali Hazelwood has this very fun, light way of writing that makes the whole book even more fun. It was a pure delight reading it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves rom-coms and who are hopelessly romantic, just like me!</p>
